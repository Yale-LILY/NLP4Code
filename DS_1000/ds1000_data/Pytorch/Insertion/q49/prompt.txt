Problem:

I have two tensors of dimension 11 * 1. I want to check how many of the 11 elements are equal in the two tensors. I think I should be able to do this in few lines like Numpy but couldn't find a similar function.


A:

<code>
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import torch
A, B = load_data()
</code>
BEGIN SOLUTION
<code>
[insert]
</code>
END SOLUTION
<code>
print(cnt_equal)
</code>
