Problem:

I have a tensor t, for example

1 2
3 4
And I would like to make it

0 0 0 0
0 1 2 0
0 3 4 0
0 0 0 0
I tried stacking with new=torch.tensor([0. 0. 0. 0.]) tensor four times but that did not work.

t = torch.arange(4).reshape(1,2,2).float()
print(t)
new=torch.tensor([[0., 0., 0.,0.]])
print(new)
r = torch.stack([t,new])  # invalid argument 0: Tensors must have same number of dimensions: got 4 and 3
new=torch.tensor([[[0., 0., 0.,0.]]])
print(new)
r = torch.stack([t,new])  # invalid argument 0: Sizes of tensors must match except in dimension 0.
I also tried cat, that did not work either.


A:

<code>
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import torch
t = load_data()
</code>
result = ... # put solution in this variable
BEGIN SOLUTION
