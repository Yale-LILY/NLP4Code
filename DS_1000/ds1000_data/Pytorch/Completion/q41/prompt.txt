Problem:

I have the tensors:

ids: shape (70,3) containing indices like [[0,1,0],[1,0,0],[0,0,1],...]

x: shape(70,3,2)

ids tensor encodes the index of bold marked dimension of x which should be selected (1 means selected, 0 not). I want to gather the selected slices in a resulting vector:

result: shape (70,2)

Background:

I have some scores (shape = (70,3)) for each of the 3 elements and want only to select the one with the highest score.
Therefore, I made the index with the highest score to be 1, and rest indexes to be 0


A:

<code>
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import torch
ids, x = load_data()
</code>
result = ... # put solution in this variable
BEGIN SOLUTION
