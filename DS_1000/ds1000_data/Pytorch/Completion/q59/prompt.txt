Problem:

I may be missing something obvious, but I can't find a way to compute this.

Given two tensors, I want to keep elements with the maximum absolute values, in each one of them as well as the sign.

I thought about

sign_x = torch.sign(x)
sign_y = torch.sign(y)
max = torch.max(torch.abs(x), torch.abs(y))
in order to eventually multiply the signs with the obtained maximums, but then I have no method to multiply the correct sign to each element that was kept and must choose one of the two tensors.


A:

<code>
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import torch
x, y = load_data()
</code>
signed_max = ... # put solution in this variable
BEGIN SOLUTION
