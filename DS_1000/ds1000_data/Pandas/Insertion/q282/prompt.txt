Problem:
I need to rename only the last column in my dataframe, the issue is there are many columns with the same name (there is a reason for this), thus I cannot use the code in other examples online. Is there a way to use something specific that just isolates the final column?
I have tried to do something like this
df.rename(columns={df.columns[-1]: 'Test'}, inplace=True)
However this then means that all columns with that same header are changed to 'Test', whereas I just want the last one to change.
I kind of need something like df.columns[-1] = 'Test'  but this doesn't work.


A:
<code>
import pandas as pd


df = pd.DataFrame([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]], columns=list('ABA'))
</code>
BEGIN SOLUTION
<code>
[insert]
</code>
END SOLUTION
<code>
print(result)
</code>
