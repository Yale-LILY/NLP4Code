Problem:
I have a dataframe with one of its column having a list at each index. I want to reversed each list and concatenate these lists into one string like '3,2,1,5,4'. I am using
ids = str(reverse(df.loc[0:index, 'User IDs'].values.tolist()))

However, this results in
'[[1,2,3,4......]]' which is not I want. Somehow each value in my list column is type str. I have tried converting using list(), literal_eval() but it does not work. The list() converts each element within a list into a string e.g. from [12,13,14...] to ['['1'',','2',','1',',','3'......]'].
How to concatenate pandas column with list values into one string? Kindly help out, I am banging my head on it for several hours.

import pandas as pd
