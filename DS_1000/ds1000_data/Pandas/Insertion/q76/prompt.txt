Problem:
I have a simple dataframe which I would like to bin for every 3 rows.


It looks like this:


    col1
0      2
1      1
2      3
3      1
4      0
and I would like to turn it into this:


    col1
0      2
1    0.5
I have already posted a similar question here but I have no Idea how to port the solution to my current use case.


Can you help me out?


Many thanks!

END SOLUTION
