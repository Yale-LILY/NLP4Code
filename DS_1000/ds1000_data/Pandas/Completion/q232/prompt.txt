Problem:
I have the following dataframe:
  text
1 "abc" 
2 "def" 
3 "ghi"
4 "jkl" 


How can I merge these rows into a dataframe with a single row like the following one?
  text 
1 "abc, def, ghi, jkl"


A:
<code>
import pandas as pd


df = pd.DataFrame({'text': ['abc', 'def', 'ghi', 'jkl']})
</code>
result = ... # put solution in this variable
BEGIN SOLUTION
