Problem:
I have a simple dataframe which I would like to bin for every 3 rows from back to front.


It looks like this:


    col1
0      2
1      1
2      3
3      1
4      0
and I would like to turn it into this:


    col1
0    1.5
1    1.333
I have already posted a similar question here but I have no Idea how to port the solution to my current use case.


Can you help me out?


Many thanks!




A:
<code>
import pandas as pd


df = pd.DataFrame({'col1':[2, 1, 3, 1, 0]})
</code>
result = ... # put solution in this variable
