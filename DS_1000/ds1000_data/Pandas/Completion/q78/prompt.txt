Problem:
I have a simple dataframe which I would like to bin for every 4 rows.


It looks like this:


    col1
0      1
1      1
2      4
3      5
4      1
5      4
and I would like to turn it into this:


    col1
0     11
1      5
I have already posted a similar question here but I have no Idea how to port the solution to my current use case.


Can you help me out?


Many thanks!




A:
<code>
import pandas as pd


df = pd.DataFrame({'col1':[1, 1, 4, 5, 1, 4]})
</code>
result = ... # put solution in this variable
