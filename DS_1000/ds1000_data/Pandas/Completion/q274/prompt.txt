Problem:
I do know some posts are quite similar to my question but none of them succeded in giving me the correct answer. I want, for each row of a pandas dataframe, to perform the average of values taken from several columns. As the number of columns tends to vary, I want this average to be performed from a list of columns.
At the moment my code looks like this:
df[Avg] = df['Col A'] + df['Col E'] + df['Col Z']


I want it to be something like :
df['Avg'] = avg(list_of_my_columns)


or
df[list_of_my_columns].avg(axis=1)


But both of them return an error. Might be because my list isn't properly created? This is how I did it:
list_of_my_columns = [df['Col A'], df['Col E'], df['Col Z']]


But this doesn't seem to work... Any ideas ? Thank you !
A:
<code>
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np


np.random.seed(10)
data = {}
for i in [chr(x) for x in range(65,91)]:
    data['Col '+i] = np.random.randint(1,100,10)
df = pd.DataFrame(data)
list_of_my_columns = ['Col A', 'Col E', 'Col Z']
</code>
df = ... # put solution in this variable
