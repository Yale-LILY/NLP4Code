Problem:
I want to make an 4 dimensional array of zeros in python. I know how to do this for a square array but I want the lists to have different lengths.
Right now I use this:
arr = numpy.zeros((20,)*4)
Which gives them all length 20 but I would like to have arr's lengths 20,10,10,2 because now I have a lot of zeros in arr that I don't use
A:
<code>
import numpy as np
</code>
BEGIN SOLUTION
<code>
[insert]
</code>
END SOLUTION
<code>
print(arr)
</code>
