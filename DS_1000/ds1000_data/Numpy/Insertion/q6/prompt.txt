Problem:
Let's say I have a 1d numpy integer array like this
a = array([-1,0,3])
I would like to encode this as a 2D one-hot array(for integers)
b = array([[1,0,0,0,0], [0,1,0,0,0], [0,0,0,0,1]])
The leftmost element always corresponds to the smallest element in `a`, and the rightmost vice versa.
Is there a quick way to do this only using numpy? Quicker than just looping over a to set elements of b, that is.
A:
<code>
import numpy as np
a = np.array([-1, 0, 3])
</code>
BEGIN SOLUTION
<code>
[insert]
</code>
END SOLUTION
<code>
print(b)
</code>
