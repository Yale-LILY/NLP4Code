Problem:
I want to reverse & convert a 1-dimensional array into a 2-dimensional array by specifying the number of columns in the 2D array. Something that would work like this:
> import numpy as np
> A = np.array([1,2,3,4,5,6,7])
> B = vec2matrix(A,ncol=2)
> B
array([[7, 6],
       [5, 4],
       [3, 2]])
Note that when A cannot be reshaped into a 2D array, we tend to discard elements which are at the beginning of A.
Does numpy have a function that works like my made-up function "vec2matrix"? (I understand that you can index a 1D array like a 2D array, but that isn't an option in the code I have - I need to make this conversion.)
A:
<code>
import numpy as np
A = np.array([1,2,3,4,5,6,7])
ncol = 2
</code>
BEGIN SOLUTION
<code>
[insert]
</code>
END SOLUTION
<code>
print(B)
</code>
