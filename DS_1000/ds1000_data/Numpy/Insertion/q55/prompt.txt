Problem:
I need to do some analysis on a large dataset from a hydrolgeology field work. I am using NumPy. I want to know how I can:
1.	multiply e.g. the row-th row of my array by a number (e.g. 5.2). And then
2.	calculate the cumulative sum of the numbers in that row.
As I mentioned I only want to work on a specific row and not the whole array. The result should be an 1-d array --- the cumulative sum.
A:
<code>
import numpy as np
a = np.random.rand(8, 5)
row = 2
multiply_number = 5.2
</code>
BEGIN SOLUTION
<code>
[insert]
</code>
END SOLUTION
<code>
print(result)
</code>
