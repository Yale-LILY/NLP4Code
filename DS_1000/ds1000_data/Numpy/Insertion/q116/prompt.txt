Problem:
I'm looking for a fast solution to MATLAB's accumarray in numpy. The accumarray accumulates the elements of an array which belong to the same index.
Note that there might be negative indices in accmap, and we treat them like list indices in Python.
 An example:
a = np.arange(1,11)
# array([ 1,  2,  3,  4,  5,  6,  7,  8,  9, 10])
accmap = np.array([0,1,0,0,0,-1,-1,2,2,1])
Result should be
array([13, 12, 30])
Is there a built-in numpy function that can do accumulation like this? Using for-loop is not what I want. Or any other recommendations?
A:
<code>
import numpy as np
a = np.arange(1,11)
accmap = np.array([0,1,0,0,0,-1,-1,2,2,1])
</code>
BEGIN SOLUTION
<code>
[insert]
</code>
END SOLUTION
<code>
print(result)
</code>
