Problem:
Say, I have an array:
import numpy as np
a = np.array([0, 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, 8, 8, 8, 10, 29, 32, 45])
How can I calculate the 2nd standard deviation for it, so I could get the value of +2sigma ? Then I can get 2nd standard deviation interval, i.e., (μ-2σ, μ+2σ).
What I want is detecting outliers of 2nd standard deviation interval from array x. 
Hopefully result should be a bool array, True for outlier and False for not.
A:
<code>
import numpy as np
a = np.array([0, 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, 8, 8, 8, 10, 29, 32, 45])
</code>
BEGIN SOLUTION
<code>
[insert]
</code>
END SOLUTION
<code>
print(result)
</code>
