Problem:

Right now, I have my data in a 3D numpy array. If I was to use MinMaxScaler fit_transform on each matrix of the array, it will normalize it column by column, whereas I wish to normalize entire matrices. Is there anyway to do that?
A:
<code>
import numpy as np
from sklearn.preprocessing import MinMaxScaler
a = np.array([[[1, 0.5, -2], [-0.5,1, 6], [1,1,1]], [[-2, -3, 1], [-0.5, 10, 6], [1,1,1]]])
</code>
BEGIN SOLUTION
<code>
[insert]
</code>
END SOLUTION
<code>
print(result)
</code>
