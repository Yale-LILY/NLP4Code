Problem:
I am waiting for another developer to finish a piece of code that will return an np array of shape (100,2000) with values of either -1,0, or 1.
In the meantime, I want to randomly create an array of the same characteristics so I can get a head start on my development and testing. The thing is that I want this randomly created array to be the same each time, so that I'm not testing against an array that keeps changing its value each time I re-run my process.
I can create my array like this, but is there a way to create it so that it's the same each time. I can pickle the object and unpickle it, but wondering if there's another way.
r = np.random.randint(3, size=(100, 2000)) - 1
Specifically, I want r_old, r_new to be generated in the same way as r, but their result should be the same.
A:
<code>
import numpy as np
</code>
BEGIN SOLUTION
<code>
[insert]
</code>
END SOLUTION
<code>
print(r_old, r_new)
</code>
