Problem:
I have a 2D list something like
a = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]] 
and I want to convert it to a 2d numpy array. Can we do it without allocating memory like
numpy.zeros((3,3))
and then storing values to it?
A:
<code>
import numpy as np
a = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]] 
</code>
BEGIN SOLUTION
<code>
[insert]
</code>
END SOLUTION
<code>
print(result)
</code>
