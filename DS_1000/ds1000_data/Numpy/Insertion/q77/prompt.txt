Problem:
In numpy, is there a nice idiomatic way of testing if all rows are equal in a 2d array?
I can do something like
np.all([np.array_equal(a[0], a[i]) for i in xrange(1,len(a))])
This seems to mix python lists with numpy arrays which is ugly and presumably also slow.
Is there a nicer/neater way?
A:
<code>
import numpy as np
a = np.repeat(np.arange(1, 6).reshape(1, -1), 3, axis = 0)
</code>
BEGIN SOLUTION
<code>
[insert]
</code>
END SOLUTION
<code>
print(result)
</code>
