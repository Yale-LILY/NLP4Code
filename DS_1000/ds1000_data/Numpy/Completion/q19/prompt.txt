Problem:
How can I get get the position (indices) of the smallest value in a multi-dimensional NumPy array `a`?
Note that I want to get the raveled index of it, in C order.
A:
<code>
import numpy as np
a = np.array([[10,50,30],[60,20,40]])
</code>
result = ... # put solution in this variable
BEGIN SOLUTION
