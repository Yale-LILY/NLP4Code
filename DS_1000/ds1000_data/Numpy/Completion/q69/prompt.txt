Problem:

>>> arr = np.array([[1,2,3,4], [5,6,7,8], [9,10,11,12]])
>>> arr
array([[ 1,  2,  3,  4],
       [ 5,  6,  7,  8],
       [ 9, 10, 11, 12]])
I am deleting the 3rd row
array([[ 1,  2,  3,  4],
       [ 5,  6,  7,  8]])
Are there any good way ?  Please consider this to be a novice question.


A:
<code>
import numpy as np
a = np.arange(12).reshape(3, 4)
</code>
a = ... # put solution in this variable
