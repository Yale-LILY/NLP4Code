Problem:
I have a list of numpy arrays, and want to check if all the arrays are equal. What is the quickest way of doing this?
I am aware of the numpy.array_equal function (https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-1.10.0/reference/generated/numpy.array_equal.html), however as far as I am aware this only applies to two arrays and I want to check N arrays against each other.
I also found this answer to test all elements in a list: check if all elements in a list are identical. However, when I try each method in the accepted answer I get an exception (ValueError: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all())
Thanks,
A:
<code>
import numpy as np
a = [np.array([1,2,3]),np.array([1,2,3]),np.array([1,2,3])]
</code>
result = ... # put solution in this variable
BEGIN SOLUTION
