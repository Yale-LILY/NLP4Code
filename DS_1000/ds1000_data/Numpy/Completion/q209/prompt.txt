Problem:
In order to get a numpy array from a list I make the following:
Suppose n = 12
np.array([i for i in range(0, n)])
And get:
array([ 0,  1,  2,  3,  4,  5,  6,  7,  8,  9, 10, 11])
Then I would like to make a (4,3) matrix from this array:
np.array([i for i in range(0, 12)]).reshape(4, 3)
and I get the following matrix:
array([[ 0,  1,  2],
       [ 3,  4,  5],
       [ 6,  7,  8],
       [ 9, 10, 11]])
But if I know that I will have 3 * n elements in the initial list how can I reshape my numpy array, because the following code
np.array([i for i in range(0,12)]).reshape(a.shape[0]/3,3)
Results in the error
TypeError: 'float' object cannot be interpreted as an integer
A:
<code>
import numpy as np
a = np.arange(12)
</code>
a = ... # put solution in this variable
