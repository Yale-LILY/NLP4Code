Problem:
I have created a multidimensional array in Python like this:
self.cells = np.empty((r,c),dtype=np.object)
Now I want to iterate through all elements of my two-dimensional array `X` and store element at each moment in result (an 1D list), in 'C' order.
How do I achieve this?
A:
<code>
import numpy as np
X = np.random.randint(2, 10, (5, 6))
</code>
result = ... # put solution in this variable
BEGIN SOLUTION
