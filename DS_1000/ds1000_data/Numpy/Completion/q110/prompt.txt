Problem:
I am trying to convert a MATLAB code in Python. I don't know how to initialize an empty matrix in Python.
MATLAB Code:
demod4(1) = [];
I want to create an empty numpy array, with shape = (3,0)

A:
<code>
import numpy as np
</code>
result = ... # put solution in this variable
BEGIN SOLUTION
<code>
