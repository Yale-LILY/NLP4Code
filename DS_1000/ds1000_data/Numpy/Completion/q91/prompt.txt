Problem:
I'm sorry in advance if this is a duplicated question, I looked for this information but still couldn't find it.
Is it possible to get a numpy array (or python list) filled with the indexes of the elements in increasing order?
For instance, the array:
a = array([4, 1, 0, 8, 5, 2])
The indexes of the elements in increasing order would give :
0 --> 2
1 --> 1
2 --> 5
4 --> 0
5 --> 4
8 --> 3
result = [2,1,5,0,4,3]
Thanks in advance!
A:
<code>
import numpy as np
a = np.array([4, 1, 0, 8, 5, 2])
</code>
result = ... # put solution in this variable
BEGIN SOLUTION
