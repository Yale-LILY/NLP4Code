Problem:
I'm working on a problem that has to do with calculating angles of refraction and what not. However, it seems that I'm unable to use the numpy.cos() function in degrees. I have tried to use numpy.degrees() and numpy.rad2deg().
degree = 90
numpy.cos(degree)
numpy.degrees(numpy.cos(degree))
But with no help. 
How do I compute cosine value using degree?
Thanks for your help.
A:
<code>
import numpy as np
degree = 90
</code>
result = ... # put solution in this variable
