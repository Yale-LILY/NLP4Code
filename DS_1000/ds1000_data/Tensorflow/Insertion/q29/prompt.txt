Problem:
I'm using tensorflow 2.10.0.
I have two 3D tensors, tensor A which has shape [B,N,S] and tensor B which also has shape [B,N,S]. What I want to get is a third tensor C, which I expect to have [B,N,N] shape, where the element C[i,j,k] = np.dot(A[i,j,:], B[i,k,:]. I also want to achieve this is a vectorized way.
Some further info: The two tensors A and B have shape [Batch_size, Num_vectors, Vector_size]. The tensor C, is supposed to represent the dot product between each element in the batch from A and each element in the batch from B, between all of the different vectors.
Hope that it is clear enough and looking forward to you answers!

A:
<code>
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

np.random.seed(10)
A = tf.constant(np.random.randint(low=0, high=5, size=(10, 20, 30)))
B = tf.constant(np.random.randint(low=0, high=5, size=(10, 20, 30)))
