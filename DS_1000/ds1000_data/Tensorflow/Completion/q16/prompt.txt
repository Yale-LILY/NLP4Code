Problem:
I'm using tensorflow 2.10.0.
I have a tensor that have shape (50, 100, 1, 512) and i want to reshape it or drop the third dimension so that the new tensor have shape (50, 100, 512).
a = tf.constant(np.random.rand(50, 100, 1, 512))


How can i solve it. Thanks


A:
<code>
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

np.random.seed(10)
a = tf.constant(np.random.rand(50, 100, 1, 512))
</code>
result = ... # put solution in this variable
