Problem:

Is there any package in Python that does data transformation like Box-Cox transformation to eliminate skewness of data?
I know about sklearn, but I was unable to find functions to do Box-Cox transformation.
How can I use sklearn to solve this?

A:

<code>
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import sklearn
data = load_data()
assert type(data) == np.ndarray
</code>
BEGIN SOLUTION
<code>
[insert]
</code>
END SOLUTION
<code>
print(box_cox_data)
</code>
