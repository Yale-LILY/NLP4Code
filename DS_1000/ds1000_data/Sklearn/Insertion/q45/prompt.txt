Problem:

I have fitted a k-means algorithm on 5000+ samples using the python scikit-learn library. I want to have the 50 samples closest (data, not just index) to a cluster center "p" (e.g. p=2) as an output, here "p" means the p^th center. How do I perform this task?

A:

<code>
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.cluster import KMeans
p, X = load_data()
assert type(X) == np.ndarray
km = KMeans()
</code>
BEGIN SOLUTION
<code>
[insert]
</code>
END SOLUTION
<code>
print(closest_50_samples)
</code>
