Problem:

Given a distance matrix, with similarity between various professors :

              prof1     prof2     prof3
       prof1     0        0.8     0.9
       prof2     0.8      0       0.2
       prof3     0.9      0.2     0
I need to perform hierarchical clustering on this data, where the above data is in the form of 2-d matrix

       data_matrix=[[0,0.8,0.9],[0.8,0,0.2],[0.9,0.2,0]]
The expected number of clusters is 2. I tried checking if I can implement it using sklearn.cluster AgglomerativeClustering but it is considering all the 3 rows as 3 separate vectors and not as a distance matrix. Can it be done using sklearn.cluster AgglomerativeClustering? prefer answer in a list like [label1, label2, ...]

A:

<code>
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import sklearn.cluster
data_matrix = load_data()
</code>
BEGIN SOLUTION
<code>
[insert]
</code>
END SOLUTION
<code>
print(cluster_labels)
</code>
