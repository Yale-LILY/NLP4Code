Problem:

I have set up a GridSearchCV and have a set of parameters, with I will find the best combination of parameters. My GridSearch consists of 12 candidate models total.

However, I am also interested in seeing the accuracy score of all of the 12, not just the best score, as I can clearly see by using the .best_score_ method. I am curious about opening up the black box that GridSearch sometimes feels like.

I see a scoring= argument to GridSearch, but I can't see any way to print out scores. Actually, I want the full results of GridSearchCV besides getting the score, in pandas dataframe.

Any advice is appreciated. Thanks in advance.


A:

<code>
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import GridSearchCV
GridSearch_fitted = load_data()
assert type(GridSearch_fitted) == sklearn.model_selection._search.GridSearchCV
</code>
BEGIN SOLUTION
<code>
[insert]
</code>
END SOLUTION
<code>
print(full_results)
</code>
