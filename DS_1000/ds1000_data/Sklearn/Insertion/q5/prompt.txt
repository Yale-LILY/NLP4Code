Problem:

I'd like to do some operations to my df. And there is an example below.
df

Col1   Col2         Col3
 C      33     [Apple, Orange, Banana]
 A      2.5    [Apple, Grape]
 B      42     [Banana]
after the operations, the df is converted into

df

Col1   Col2   Apple   Orange   Banana   Grape
 C      33     1        1        1       0
 A      2.5    1        0        0       1
 B      42     0        0        1       0
Generally, I want this pandas column which consisting of a list of String names broken down into as many columns as the unique names.
Maybe it's like one-hot-encode them (note that value 1 representing a given name existing in a row and then 0 is absence).
Could any one give me any suggestion of pandas or sklearn methods? thanks!

A:

<code>
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import sklearn
df = load_data()
</code>
BEGIN SOLUTION
<code>
[insert]
</code>
END SOLUTION
<code>
print(df_out)
</code>
