Problem:

Is there any package in Python that does data transformation like Box-Cox transformation to eliminate skewness of data? In R this could be done using caret package:

set.seed(1)
predictors = data.frame(x1 = rnorm(1000,
                                   mean = 5,
                                   sd = 2),
                        x2 = rexp(1000,
                                  rate=10))

require(caret)

trans = preProcess(predictors,
                   c("BoxCox", "center", "scale"))
predictorsTrans = data.frame(
      trans = predict(trans, predictors))
I know about sklearn, but I was unable to find functions to do Box-Cox transformation.
How can I use sklearn to solve this?

A:

<code>
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import sklearn
data = load_data()
assert type(data) == np.ndarray
</code>
box_cox_data = ... # put solution in this variable
BEGIN SOLUTION
