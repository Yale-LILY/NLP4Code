Problem:

Does scikit-learn provide facility to use SVM for regression, using a gaussian kernel? I looked at the APIs and I don't see any. Has anyone built a package on top of scikit-learn that does this?
Note to use default arguments

A:

<code>
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import sklearn
X, y = load_data()
assert type(X) == np.ndarray
assert type(y) == np.ndarray
# fit, then predict X
</code>
predict = ... # put solution in this variable
BEGIN SOLUTION
