Problem:

I have used sklearn for Cross-validation and want to do a more visual information with the values of each model.

The problem is, I can't only get the name of the templates.
Instead, the parameters always come altogether. How can I only retrieve the name of the models without its parameters?
Or does it mean that I have to create an external list for the names?

here I have a piece of code:

for model in models:
   scores = cross_val_score(model, X, y, cv=5)
   print(f'Name model: {model} , Mean score: {scores.mean()}')
But I also obtain the parameters:

Name model: LinearRegression(copy_X=True, fit_intercept=True, n_jobs=1, normalize=False), Mean score: 0.8066782865537986
In fact I want to get the information this way:

Name Model: LinearRegression, Mean Score: 0.8066782865537986
Any ideas to do that? Thanks!

A:

<code>
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
model = LinearRegression()
</code>
model_name = ... # put solution in this variable
BEGIN SOLUTION
