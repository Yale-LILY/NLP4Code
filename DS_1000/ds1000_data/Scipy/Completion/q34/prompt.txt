Problem:
I have a sparse 988x1 vector (stored in col, a column in a csr_matrix) created through scipy.sparse. Is there a way to gets its mean and standard deviation without having to convert the sparse matrix to a dense one?
numpy.mean seems to only work for dense vectors.

A:
<code>
import numpy as np
from scipy.sparse import csr_matrix

np.random.seed(10)
arr = np.random.randint(4,size=(988,988))
sA = csr_matrix(arr)
col = sA.getcol(0)
</code>
mean, standard_deviation = ... # put solution in these variables
BEGIN SOLUTION
