Problem:
I have the following code to run Wilcoxon rank-sum test 
print stats.ranksums(pre_course_scores, during_course_scores)
RanksumsResult(statistic=8.1341352369246582, pvalue=4.1488919597127145e-16)

However, I am interested in extracting the pvalue from the result. I could not find a tutorial about this. i.e.Given two ndarrays, pre_course_scores, during_course_scores, I want to know the pvalue of ranksum. Can someone help?

A:
<code>
import numpy as np
from scipy import stats
np.random.seed(10)
pre_course_scores = np.random.randn(10)
during_course_scores = np.random.randn(10)
</code>
p_value = ... # put solution in this variable
