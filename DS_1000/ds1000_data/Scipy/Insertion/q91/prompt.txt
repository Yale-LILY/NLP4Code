Problem:


Suppose I have a integer matrix which represents who has emailed whom and how many times. I want to find people that have not emailed each other. For social network analysis I'd like to make a simple undirected graph. So I need to convert the matrix to binary matrix.
My question: is there a fast, convenient way to reduce the decimal matrix to a binary matrix.
Such that:
26, 3, 0
3, 195, 1
0, 1, 17
Becomes:
0, 0, 1
0, 0, 0
1, 0, 0

A:


<code>
import scipy
import numpy as np
a = np.array([[26, 3, 0], [3, 195, 1], [0, 1, 17]])
</code>
BEGIN SOLUTION
<code>
[insert]
</code>
END SOLUTION
<code>
print(a)
</code>
