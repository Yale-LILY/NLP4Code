## Cristina, John, Clarissa and Sarah want to give their mother a photo album for her birthday. Cristina brings 7 photos, John brings 10 photos and Sarah brings 9 photos. If the photo album has 40 slots available, how many photos does Clarissa need to bring in order to complete the photo album?
n_photo_cristina = 7
n_photo_john = 10
n_photo_sarah = 9
n_photo_total = n_photo_cristina + n_photo_john + n_photo_sarah
n_slots = 40
n_slots_left = n_slots - n_photo_total
answer = n_slots_left

## Katy, Wendi, and Carrie went to a bread-making party.  Katy brought three 5-pound bags of flour.  Wendi brought twice as much flour as Katy, but Carrie brought 5 pounds less than the amount of flour Wendi brought.  How much more flour, in ounces, did Carrie bring than Katy?
pound_flour_katy = 3 * 5
pound_flour_wendi = pound_flour_katy * 2
pound_flour_carrie = pound_flour_wendi - 5
pound_diff_carrie_katy = pound_flour_carrie - pound_flour_katy
ounce_diff_carrie_katy = pound_diff_carrie_katy * 16
answer = ounce_diff_carrie_katy

## James takes 2 Tylenol tablets that are 375 mg each, every 6 hours.  How many mg does he take a day?
mg_tylenol_per_tablet = 375
mg_tylenol_taken_each_time = 2 * mg_tylenol_per_tablet
hours_per_day = 24
times_per_day = hours_per_day / 6
mg_each_day = mg_tylenol_taken_each_time * times_per_day
answer = mg_each_day

## Kyle bakes 60 cookies and 32 brownies. Kyle eats 2 cookies and 2 brownies. Kyle's mom eats 1 cookie and 2 brownies. If Kyle sells a cookie for $1 and a brownie for $1.50, how much money will Kyle make if he sells all of his baked goods?
n_cookies = 60
n_brownies = 32
n_cookies_left_after_kyle = n_cookies - 2
n_brownies_left_after_kyle = n_brownies - 2
n_cookies_left_after_kyle_mom = n_cookies_left_after_kyle - 1
n_brownies_left_after_kyle_mom = n_brownies_left_after_kyle - 2
money_earned_kyle = n_cookies_left_after_kyle_mom * 1 + n_brownies_left_after_kyle_mom * 1.5
answer = money_earned_kyle

## There were 63 Easter eggs in the yard.  Hannah found twice as many as Helen.  How many Easter eggs did Hannah find?
n_easter_eggs = 63
unit_times = 2
total_units = unit_times + 1
n_easter_eggs_per_unit = n_easter_eggs / total_units
n_easter_eggs_helen = n_easter_eggs_per_unit * 1
n_easter_eggs_hannah = n_easter_eggs_per_unit * 2
answer = n_easter_eggs_hannah

## Ethan is reading a sci-fi book that has 360 pages. He read 40 pages on Saturday morning and another 10 pages at night. The next day he read twice the total pages as on Saturday. How many pages does he have left to read?
n_pages = 360
total_page_saturday = 40 + 10
total_page_next_day = total_page_saturday * 2
total_pages_read = total_page_saturday + total_page_next_day
n_pages_left = n_pages - total_pages_read
answer = n_pages_left

## A library has a number of books. 35% of them are intended for children and 104 of them are for adults. How many books are in the library?
percent_books_for_children = 0.35
percent_books_for_adults = 1.0 - percent_books_for_children
n_books_for_adults = 104
n_books_in_total = n_books_for_adults / percent_books_for_adults
answer = n_books_in_total

## Tyler has 21 CDs. He gives away a third of his CDs to his friend. Then he goes to the music store and buys 8 brand new CDs. How many CDs does Tyler have now?
n_cds_tyler = 21
percent_cds_given_away =  1.0 / 3.0
n_cds_left_after_giving_away = n_cds_tyler - n_cds_tyler * percent_cds_given_away
n_new_cds_purchased = 8
n_cds_now = n_cds_left_after_giving_away + n_new_cds_purchased
answer = n_cds_now
